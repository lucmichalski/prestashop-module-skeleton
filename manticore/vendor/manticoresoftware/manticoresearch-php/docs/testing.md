Testing
-----
Testing is carried out using Docker and Docker Compose in order to guarantee a consistent testing environment.

The following documentation assumes that you are using a shell that currently has a working directory in the root of
the project.

Create Containers
======
```bash
docker-compose up
```
This may take a few minutes depending on your internet connection.

Attach to Command Line Interface
======
The following will get you a shell on PHP command line container.
```bash
docker-compose exec phpcli7 /bin/bash
```

Running PHPUnit
======
Simply run PHPUnit

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

Generating Local Code Coverage
======
```bash
phpdbg -qrr vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html report test
```
A succesful test run will look like this:
```bash
root@807c5bdfe018:/var/www# phpdbg -qrr vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html report test
